// tools/skill-eval.test.ts — the suite checker, against planted suites.
//
// Only the checker is tested here, and that is the honest boundary: `run` costs about $1.50 a
// case and depends on a model, so it cannot be a test. What CAN be proven cheaply is that the
// checker fails the shapes that matter — which is the half wired into CI.
//
// Every case below is a shape that either happened or would silently pass:
//   - the two schemas the real suites used before 2026-09-17 (`skill`+`cases` vs
//     `skill_name`+`evals`), which is why that is a named failure and not a tolerated alias;
//   - a case with no assertions, which grades as a pass because there is nothing to fail;
//   - a fixture path pointing at a file that is not there;
//   - a trigger test made of obviously-irrelevant prompts, which any description passes.
//
// Run: bun test tools/skill-eval.test.ts
