# Resolve the Bitwarden desktop app's SSH agent socket into SSH_AUTH_SOCK, if
# present. Single source for WHERE that socket lives — sourced by both the shell
# config (capabilities/shell/init.zsh) and any tool that needs the vault agent
# (tools/backup.sh). Guarded: a no-op when the app isn't running / not installed,
# so it never points SSH_AUTH_SOCK at a dead socket. POSIX-ish on purpose so
# zsh and bash can both source it. bash 3.2-safe.
#
# Candidate order covers each platform's Bitwarden desktop packaging: the macOS
# app sandbox container, the Linux snap and flatpak sandboxes, then the plain
# ~/.bitwarden-ssh-agent.sock the .deb/.rpm and AppImage builds use. On WSL there
# is usually no Bitwarden desktop at all, so this stays a clean no-op there.
