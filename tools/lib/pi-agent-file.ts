// tools/lib/pi-agent-file.ts — translate a Claude-Code-native agent file into the
// shape pi-subagents can load.
//
// Axon keeps ONE canonical agent file per agent, written for Claude Code, under
// Packs/<pack>/agents/. pi does not read those, for two reasons that are both
// verified against @tintinweb/pi-subagents 0.19.0 and pi's own tool registry:
//
// 1. `tools:` names differ in CASE, and `Glob` does not exist in pi at all.
//    Claude Code's are TitleCase (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`); pi's builtins are
//    lowercase and search with `find`. This is not a cosmetic difference: an
//    unrecognised name is reported by pi-subagents as a `tools-error` and dropped
//    from the agent's allowlist (upstream issue #75, "previously this produced a
//    silently broken agent"). A member copied across unchanged would therefore
//    come up with NO read tool, every claim it made would be `[unverified]`, and
//    the council clerk would have nothing to resolve — the check the Pack README
//    calls "the point" would be structurally dead on pi. So an unmapped name is a
//    hard error here, never a passthrough: the failure it prevents is silent.
//
// 2. `model:` is dropped. The Pack pins `sonnet` for members and `opus` for the
//    sceptic and the attack lenses, which is a Claude Code idiom. On pi the
//    recorded decision (2026-09-16) is to inherit the session model, so the
//    tiering described in Packs/deliberation/README.md is Claude-Code-only.
//
// Deliberately NOT a generator for the Claude Code copy: that file is the source
// and stays hand-written. This runs one way only, at deploy time, in packs-pi.
