// Tests for tools/lib/demo-endpoints.ts (#168).
//
// The property that matters here is that a browser path resolves to the SAME capability the
// dashboard's dev-server proxy would send it to. Those are two implementations of one rule
// (dashboard/vite.config.ts and this module), both reading tools/capability.sh registry, and
// if they drift the demo records one capability's answer under another's path — which looks
// like working software right up until somebody reads the page.
