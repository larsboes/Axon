# The backup producer's link guard, as a test.
#
# The guard exists because tools/restore.sh refuses any archive carrying a symlink, and
# tools/backup.sh used to produce them anyway: the vault shipped a 704 MB archive that verified
# its size, wrote a receipt, reported success, and could never have been restored (2026-08-29).
#
# It was written as `if printf ... | grep -q '^[lhbcps]'`. That form cannot work under
# `set -o pipefail`: `-q` exits at the first match, which closes the pipe while printf is still
# writing, printf dies on SIGPIPE, and pipefail makes the pipeline report 141 — so a MATCH
# evaluated as FALSE and the guard shipped the archive it exists to refuse. Found 2026-09-23 by
# rehearsing a restore of the vault archive; its only trace was a `printf: write error: Broken
# pipe` on stderr that reads like noise. Every archive since 2026-08-29 was unchecked.
#
# So the assertion that matters is behavioural and it runs the guard under pipefail, which is
# what production does: a reintroduced `-q` makes the with-link case exit 0 and this test fails.
# A structural grep for the idiom would be weaker — it would not see the same bug written a
# different way.
#
# The function is EXTRACTED from the real script rather than copied, and the extraction is
# asserted non-empty. A duplicate body would keep passing after the real one changed, which is
# the failure mode this whole test is about.
