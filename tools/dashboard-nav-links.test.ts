// Every internal link must survive a base path (#170).
//
// This is a source scan rather than a behavioural test, because the bug it catches is
// invisible in the only environment anyone develops in. `paths.base` is empty on a real
// machine, so `href="/calendar"` and `href={link("/calendar")}` are byte-identical there and
// stay identical through every test, every dev session and every code review. They differ
// only on the published demo, which is served from a subdirectory — where the raw form sent
// every click to the domain root and GitHub answered with its own 404.
//
// A reviewer cannot be expected to hold that in their head across 37 call sites. A grep can.
//
// It lives in tools/ rather than beside the dashboard because SvelteKit's generated tsconfig
// type-checks everything under `src/`, and `bun run check` then fails on `bun:test` and
// `import.meta.dir`, which are Bun's and not the browser's. Every other Bun test in this
// repository is here too, and the root `bun test` finds it either way.
