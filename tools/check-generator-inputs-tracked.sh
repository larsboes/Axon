# check-generator-inputs-tracked.sh — every file tools/generate-architecture.sh reads off
# disk must be tracked by git (CI: repo gates).
#
# The generator globs capabilities/*/README.md, capabilities/*/service.toml, Packs/*/pack.toml
# and libs/*/README.md. An UNTRACKED manifest feeds real data into ARCHITECTURE.md, and then
# nobody else can reproduce it: the freshness gate passes locally because it globs the same
# working tree, and CI clones and gets a different answer. That is the local-green/CI-red
# shape, and it has bitten this repo before (the 2026-07-16 note about untracked capabilities
# appearing in a committed ARCHITECTURE.md).
#
# This is the surviving half of tools/check-bazel-package-labels.sh, deleted 2026-08-25 with
# the rest of Bazel (PRD Q44). The half that went was the label list: cross-package labels
# only existed because Bazel's glob() could not cross a package boundary, and a plain shell
# generator reads the whole tree.
#
# Usage: tools/check-generator-inputs-tracked.sh
# Exit 0 = every generator input is tracked, 1 = at least one is not.
