// tools/ci-local.ts — run a CI job's steps on this machine, from CI's own definition.
//
// CI has been red on this repository for stretches measured in days, and the only way to
// learn that was to push and wait. The repo-gates job takes about twenty seconds here;
// the push-and-wait cycle around it is minutes. That gap is the whole reason this exists.
//
// THE STEP LIST IS NOT WRITTEN DOWN HERE. It is read out of .github/workflows/ci.yml,
// because a second copy of a gate list is a copy that goes stale — the same argument
// ci.yml already makes for discovering `tools/*.test.sh` with a glob rather than listing
// them (Axon#116). Add a gate to the repo-gates job and it runs here on the next
// invocation, with nobody editing this file.
//
// What is safe to replay locally is a judgement, not a derivation, and it lives in
// tools/lib/ci-workflow.ts beside the reason for each verdict. This file owns the I/O and
// the process handling and nothing else.
//
//   tools/ci-local list             every job, and whether it runs here
//   tools/ci-local run repo-gates   CI's repo gates, in CI's order
//   tools/ci-local run bun-tests    bun test, then every tools/*.test.sh
//
// Exit 0 = every step passed. 1 = a step failed. 2 = usage, or a refused job.

/**
 * Run one step the way a runner does: bash, `-e`, output straight through.
 *
 * GitHub's default shell for a Linux `run:` block is `bash -e {0}`, and a step that sets
 * more (`set -uo pipefail`, which the shell-tests loop does) still gets exactly what it
 * asks for.
 *
 * Output is inherited rather than captured, so a suite that takes minutes prints as it
 * goes. The `::group::` lines a step emits are GitHub's fold markers and appear here as
 * plain text — left alone, because rewriting a step's output is the first move toward
 * running something other than what CI runs.
