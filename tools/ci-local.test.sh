# here, named, with the rest of the job still measured. A runner that answers the same for
# a known-bad input as for a known-good one is measuring something other than the gates —
# the sixth silent failure in PRD §13.1.
#
# Every case builds its own checkout under /tmp with its own .github/workflows/ci.yml, so
# nothing here needs a failing gate to exist in the real repository. That is what --root is
