//! A marked region a machine may regenerate, inside a file a human owns.
//!
//! `capabilities/trips/README.md` specified this in prose a month before anything
//! implemented it: regenerate only a marked Axon-owned section, preserve
//! everything outside it, and record a conflict rather than choosing between two
//! changed revisions. Every capability that wants to write back to a knowledge
//! store needs the same primitive, so it lives here rather than inside `trips`.
//!
//! ## The shape on disk
//!
//! ```text
//! <!-- axon:begin owner=finance v=1 sha=1a2b3c4d5e6f7890 -->
//! anything the machine generated
//! <!-- axon:end owner=finance -->
//! ```
//!
//! HTML comments because Obsidian renders them as nothing, so the note stays
//! readable. The owner is on both markers so two capabilities can each hold a
//! region in one note without either having to know about the other.
//!
//! ## Why the hash is in the marker
//!
//! Conflict detection needs to know what the machine last wrote. Storing that
//! anywhere else means a second source of truth that can go missing, get restored
//! from an older backup, or disagree with the file. Putting it in the marker makes
//! the file self-describing: the only input the check needs is the file itself.
//!
//! It is FNV-1a rather than a cryptographic digest, and that is deliberate. The
//! question being asked is "did a human touch this since we wrote it", not "is
//! this a forgery". FNV-1a is nine lines and no dependency, which is what this
//! crate is built to hold to. An adversary who wants to hide an edit from their
//! own note-taking system has already won.
//!
//! ## What this deliberately is not
//!
//! Not a filesystem API. Everything here is a pure function from string to
//! string, so the caller keeps the read, the write, and the choice of whether a
//! conflict should stop the run. It also makes every case below testable without
//! a temp directory.
//!
//! Not a merge. Two changed revisions produce [`RegionOutcome::Conflict`] carrying
//! both, and the caller decides. Silently picking one is the failure mode this
//! whole thing exists to prevent.
