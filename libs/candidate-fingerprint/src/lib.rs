//! The one identity of a reviewed import candidate.
//!
//! A candidate fingerprint is the SHA-256 of the tuple that makes an imported
//! row that row and no other: when it was booked, what it moved, what it said,
//! and which account it moved on. `capabilities/finance` mints it at import
//! time and writes it into the journal as the `source-id` tag; the projection
//! carries it; `capabilities/places` re-derives it from the raw export to hang
//! a venue on a transaction it never stored (`capabilities/places/README.md`,
//! D2).
//!
//! # Why this is a crate and not a copy
//!
//! It was two copies until 2026-08-28 — `capabilities/finance/src/import.rs`
//! and `capabilities/places/src/backfill.rs` — and one of them wrote so:
//! "The algorithm is a deliberate copy". Measured that day against the live
//! store, 263 rows of `places_transaction_places` resolve only while the two
//! agree byte for byte. A divergence would not raise an error. It would
//! silently stop matching, and the backfill would report the rows as unmatched
//! and move on, because reporting an unmatched row is its honest-failure rule.
//!
//! So the hash lives once. `places` may not depend on `finance` (a capability
//! reaching into another capability's crate is the boundary this repo does not
//! cross), and the shape belongs to neither of them alone, so it is a lib both
//! depend on instead.
//!
//! # The format is frozen
//!
//! Every byte below is load-bearing: the separator, the field order, the
//! decimal-free integer cents, the `csv-occurrence` literal. Changing any of
//! them orphans every live link and every `source-id` already written into the
//! canonical journal. This crate has no migration path by design — a new
//! identity scheme would be a new function with a new name, not an edit here.

/// What makes an imported row that row.

/// The two callers differ only in how much of it they know, and each states its

///
/// - `finance` reads all six from the CSV mapping, so `currency` may be any
///   declared code and `source_reference` is `Some` whenever the bank gave one.
/// - `places` re-derives from the raw American Express export, where every
///   measured row has an empty reference cell and an EUR currency cell, so it
///   passes `currency: "EUR"` and `source_reference: None`. Those are the two
///   assumptions its parity rests on, and a row that breaks either one hashes
///   differently and is reported unmatched rather than guessed.
