/// PDF, through [xberg](https://github.com/xberg-io/xberg) (`=1.0.5`).
///
/// Registered for `Pdf` only. xberg reads HTML too and returns more text than
/// `Builtin` on every URL in the recorded benchmark, but it is an extractor and
/// not a readability cleaner: its output keeps navigation and share widgets,
/// and the short-line share runs 0.03-1.00. Swapping the HTML path to it is a
/// separate change with a scorecard already in place, the corpus gate's `html`
/// class, rather than a side effect of wanting PDFs.
///
/// **Its PDF output is last-resort quality, measured rather than assumed.** On
/// arXiv 2608.02599 (2026, two-column) the text is correct but woven column
/// against column, line by line, so prose order is lost. On arXiv 0704.0001
/// (2007, Type1 fonts) every `c` is dropped: "Abstrat", "Mihigan", "quantum
/// hromo dynamis". Both took 2.4s and 11.7s respectively, against ~0.3s for
/// the same papers as HTML.
///
/// That is why the PDF rung sits below both HTML hosts in
/// `comms::media::fetch_arxiv` rather than replacing them, and why `producer`
/// is stored per item: an embedding built from scrambled columns is not the
/// same evidence as one built from LaTeXML output, and nothing downstream can
/// tell them apart without being told.
