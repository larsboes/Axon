/**
 * The Home ladder's "trip closed, retrospective open" decision kind.
 *
 * Band 610, an ADDITION to PRD §8.1's table, ruled by §8.2: "when a trip
 * closes, the dashboard raises one decision with three fields". It sits between
 * `task` (620) and `opportunity` (600) — a closed trip is a small, bounded thing
 * to answer, and it is never allowed to outrank a task that is actually due.
 *
 * The 45-day expiry is NOT here. It lives in
 * `capabilities/trips/src/store.rs::pending_retrospectives`, which is the route
 * this loader calls, so the rule has exactly one home: a retrospective filled
 * from a memory that is gone is a fabrication, and that judgement belongs to the
 * capability that owns the record.
 *
 * Relative imports throughout, so this module resolves under plain `bun test` —
 * the reason `tools/dashboard-nav-links.test.ts` records for `nav.ts`.
