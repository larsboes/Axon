//! The in-process job map behind `POST /api/plan-search`.
//!
//! Ported from `capabilities/interior/src/api.rs` (`Auftraege`), with its
//! reasons kept because they are the reasons here too:
//!
//! - **Nothing is evicted while it runs.** A running job still has its writer
//!   in `spawn_blocking`. Dropping the entry would leave that writer writing
//!   into nothing and would answer 404 for a search that ran for minutes.
//! - **The eleventh search is refused, not dropped.** Ten concurrent searches
//!   is a load nobody asked for; a refusal with a sentence is honest, a silent
//!   drop is not.
//! - **Elapsed time is computed on read.** A job that had to count its own
//!   runtime would need a second thread for nothing.
//!
//! Deliberately no table. A ranked option space is a list of proposals, not a
//! fact about a trip, so it may die with the process; what is worth keeping
//! becomes durable through `POST /api/plan-search/:id/adopt`, which writes one
//! `option_set` row. The result is a §6.2 derived aggregate, C1: it holds a
//! companion COUNT and never a register row, and it is never projected.
