//! Axon's travel stack could search and could rank, and the ranking weights were
//! the same four constants for every person and every trip. The interests a plan
//! carried were echoed back to the page and read by nothing. This module is the
//! missing half: a stated profile with hard limits a search must obey, weights
//! that are the traveller's rather than the repo's, and a `basis` map that says
//! for every single field whether the operator typed it, something derived it, or
//! it is still the built-in default.
//!
//! The `basis` map is not decoration. `soft.budget_fit` set to `0.30` because a
//! person decided that, and `0.30` because nobody has looked yet, produce
//! identical ranking behaviour and completely different confidence. A profile
//! that cannot tell those apart is a profile that will be trusted further than
//! it deserves, which is the failure `capabilities/punctuality` refuses by
//! returning `None` rather than a zero.
