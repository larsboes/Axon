//! Running a host command and reading its stdout, with one failure shape.
//!
//! Every read in this crate is unprivileged and non-mutating, so the only two things that can
//! go wrong are "the command is not here" and "the command refused". Both must be named rather
//! than turned into an empty result: an exposure report that says nothing because a tool was
//! missing reads exactly like a host with nothing exposed
//! (Packs/axon/skills/axon/references/shared-failure-policy.md).
