//! Cross-process admission control for the local inference server.
//!
//! ## Why a lock and not a semaphore
//!
//! On 2026-08-05 four concurrent prefills pushed oMLX past its hard memory
//! watermark and it aborted all four. Two of them were feed digests. Nothing in
//! Axon knew the others were running, because the competing consumers are
//! separate processes: comms-server, graphify, the Pulse DA, anything else that
//! resolves the summarization role. An in-process semaphore bounds one of them
//! and lets the rest collide exactly as before.
//!
//! A SQLite write lock on a small dedicated file is the mechanism. It was a
//! Postgres advisory lock until PRD Q45 retired the server; SQLite has no
//! advisory locks, but a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on a file nobody else writes buys the
//! same two properties that earned the advisory lock over a lock *file* with a
//! pid in it. The lock is held by an open connection, so a process that dies
//! mid-request releases it — the OS drops the file lock with the descriptor —
//! and waiting is done by SQLite's `busy_timeout` rather than by a polling loop.
//!
//! A file of its own, not the shared database. Holding the shared file's write
//! lock for the length of a model call would stall every capability's writes for
//! twenty seconds at a time, which is a far worse outcome than the contention
//! this exists to prevent. The lock file carries no rows and is never read.
//!
//! ## Why the cap is one
//!
//! oMLX already batches and schedules; what it does not do is refuse work it
//! cannot fit, which is how a fourth request turns three healthy ones into four
//! aborted ones. One at a time is the setting that cannot produce that. It
//! costs throughput only when two consumers want the GPU at once, and in that
//! situation the alternative was not parallelism — it was a memory abort.
//!
//! ## Why the cap is one *per backend*
//!
//! The first version held one lock for the whole machine, which was right while
//! oMLX was the only local server. It stopped being right the moment Apple
//! Foundation Models joined it: AFM runs on the Neural Engine at zero Metal
//! cost and shares no memory pool with oMLX, so an AFM digest that waits for an
//! oMLX prefill to finish waits ninety seconds for a resource it was never
//! going to touch, and is then told the machine is busy. The resource being
//! protected is a *backend's* memory, not the machine's, so the lock is keyed
//! by backend name: `foundation-models` and `omlx` contend with themselves and
//! with every other process resolving the same backend, and with nobody else.
//!
//! ## What a caller sees when the wait runs out
//!
//! `Outcome::CapacityAborted`, which is retryable and reported to a reader as a
//! machine condition. A background drain picks the item up on its next pass; an
//! operator pressing Regenerate is told the machine is busy rather than left
//! watching a spinner for the length of somebody else's transcript.
