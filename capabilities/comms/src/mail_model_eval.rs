//! Offline agreement gate for the mail model rung.
//!
//! **Zero model calls.** It joins a frozen corpus of hand-written labels to the
//! verdicts a shadow pass already stored, keyed by triage id. That split is
//! what makes the number reproducible and is why the redaction gate it copies
//! is a gate at all: a runner that re-prompted would need a live model server,
//! about a hundred sequential calls per run, and would produce a different
//! number every time. All the model time lives in the pass, which already has a
//! receipt, a state ledger and a bounded retry; the scoring stays pure. Drift
//! between the two is impossible because this file builds no prompt.
//!
//! What it measures, and why each one:
//!
//! - **the control**, which needs no model either. Every fixture the rung sees
//!   is a fallback row, so the deterministic classifier answered `aktiv` for
//!   all of them, and its agreement is simply the share of hand-written labels
//!   reading `aktiv` — computable from the corpus alone, before anything runs.
//! - **model agreement**, against the same labels.
//! - **false eviction**: a mail whose label IS `aktiv` that the model proposes
//!   moving out of it. Every applied write is an eviction from `aktiv`, and a
//!   correctly-`aktiv` mail moved out of it vanishes from the operator's
//!   ladder. That is the one failure here that costs a decision, so it has its
//!   own ceiling and the ceiling is a stated policy judgement rather than a
//!   measurement.
//! - **the urgency band error**, mapping the model's continuous 0-10000
//!   self-report onto the corpus's four ordinal bands. Urgency ranks nothing
//!   until this number exists.
//!
//! A fixture whose stored verdict is missing, or was reached against a
//! different item revision or a different prompt, is **skipped with a named
//! reason** rather than scored. An all-skipped corpus is a FAIL, never a
//! perfect score.
//!
//! The corpus itself lives in the private overlay beside
//! `comms-redaction-shadow.json`, with a companion `.md` holding the write-up.
//! The path in this repository (`eval/mail-stream-corpus.json`) deliberately
//! does not exist; the operator passes the overlay path as `argv[1]`.
