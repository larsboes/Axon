//! One path from a swept Gmail thread to a stored proposal.
//!
//! Both sweep entry points — the `comms` CLI and comms-server's HTTP sweep —
//! come through here, and that is the entire point of the module existing. The
//! redaction gate below is only a gate if there is no second way in; when the
//! two call sites each built their own `TriageItem` they had already drifted
//! apart once, and a gate added to one of them would have been a gate over
//! half the traffic.
//!
//! What the gate does: classify from metadata, then, for the classes whose
//! metadata is itself the payload, redact the stored review fields *before*
//! the row is written. A one-time code arrives in a subject line; persisting
//! that subject verbatim publishes it to a log, an API response and a
//! dashboard in one step, and no later deletion un-publishes it.
