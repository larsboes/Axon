//! Markdown event notes, read once and imported on purpose.
//!
//! Calendar already accepted entries four ways: typed by hand, materialized
//! from a rhythm, reviewed out of a Google draft, promoted from a scouting
//! opportunity. What it had no path for was a directory of structured markdown
//! event notes — so an operator holding one either kept two editable stores of
//! the same events forever, or wrote into calendar's tables behind the
//! capability's back. Both are worse than an importer.
//!
//! ## The shape of the contract
//!
//! **Scanning never writes.** [`scan`] reads a declared root, parses what it
//! finds, and hands back both the entries it *would* write and every record it
//! refused, each with the reason. Nothing reaches the store until [`plan`]'s
//! output is passed to an explicit import call with the ids to write.
//!
//! **Identity is stable and derived, never invented.** An imported entry is
//! keyed `(source, external_id)` where `source` is the declared source id and
//! `external_id` is the note's path relative to the declared root. Re-importing
//! updates in place through the unique index calendar already carries, so the
//! second run of a scan produces no duplicates.
//!
//! **Uncertain means [`Commitment::Possible`].** The status vocabulary of a
//! notes system is not calendar's commitment model, and only two values map
//! cleanly onto "this is happening". Everything else — including a status this
//! code has never seen — lands on `possible`, which shows as evidence and
//! blocks no day.
//!
//! **Malformed times fail closed.** A note with no start, an end before its
//! start, or one date-only side and one timed side is reported and skipped. It
//! is never guessed into a plausible entry: an event silently placed on the
//! wrong day is worse than an event that visibly did not import.
//!
//! ## What this module will never do
//!
//! Delete, move or rewrite a source note. The import is one-directional by
//! construction and there is no API here that could be pointed at the vault as
//! a writer. Deciding a note has been superseded is the operator's call, made
//! after they have seen the entries land.
