//! Phase E, the half that has no network in it: Google's wire shapes, the
//! mapping onto `NewEntry`, the draft rule, the conflict decision and the
//! export body.
//!
//! Pure over its inputs, the same call `correlate.rs` made — every rule here
//! is unit-testable against a recorded `events.list` payload with no token, no
//! socket and no database. `google_sync.rs` is the part that talks to Google.
//!
//! Three things this module is deliberately strict about:
//!
//! * **Nothing from Google becomes an authoritative block.** An imported event
//!   lands at `Commitment::Possible`, which the correlation layer caps at
//!   `Free`, until the operator adopts it. See [`IMPORT_COMMITMENT`].
//! * **Axon wins a disagreement.** [`decide`] never overwrites an entry the
//!   operator has already adopted; the divergence is reported, not applied.
//! * **No date is guessed.** An event whose schedule this module cannot read
//!   exactly is skipped with a reason, never imported with an invented time —
//!   the same contract Phase A's Luma promotion states.
