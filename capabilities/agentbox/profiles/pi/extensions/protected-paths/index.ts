/**
 * Protected paths — the seatbelt, not the boundary.
 *
 * The micro-VM is what actually contains this agent: only /workspace is mounted, so
 * there is no host home to protect. This extension exists for the two cases the VM
 * doesn't cover — the day someone widens a mount, and the agent's own config
 * directory, which holds the model API key in plaintext because the agent needs to
 * read it.
 *
 * Adapted from pi's own examples/extensions/protected-paths.ts (MIT, earendil-works/pi),
 * extended with read coverage, bash-command scanning and secret filename patterns.
 * Paths below are container paths, deliberately: os.homedir() inside the box is
 * /home/agent and says nothing about the host.
