//! The wikilink graph, and which links resolve to a note that exists.
//!
//! ## Why resolution is a hashmap and not a search
//!
//! Obsidian resolves a bare `[[Name]]` by shortest-unique-path, which sounds
//! like it needs the whole tree. Measured on this vault it mostly does not:
//! 2,757 notes over 2,659 distinct basenames, **89 of those names duplicated**
//! (2026-09-08; it was 14 when this was written, and that growth is the reason
//! the rung below matters more than it used to). A map keyed on basename
//! answers the rest exactly, and the 89 are reported as ambiguous rather than
//! silently resolved to whichever the walk hit first. That is the honest shape —
//! a resolver that picks one and says nothing turns a wrong target into a
//! passing check, which is worse than a broken link because nothing flags it.
//!
//! ## Why frontmatter links are counted, and counted separately
//!
//! 10,995 of this vault's 22,344 wikilinks do not sit in prose at all.
//! They sit in `categories:`, `related:` and `sources:` — which is to say the
//! membership graph every MOC is fed by, and the provenance edges the whole
//! four-bucket model rests on. A link check that reads only the body misses
//! them and reports a vault 60% smaller than it is. This one was written that
//! way first and the acceptance fixture caught it.
//!
//! They stay a separate count because they behave differently: a folder move
//! rewrites a prose link and an editor rewrites a `categories:` entry, and a
//! number that mixes them cannot tell you which kind of repair you owe.
//!
//! ## Why dead links are counted twice
//!
//! A vault carries link-shaped text that was never meant to resolve: block
//! references (`[[#^abc123]]`), embeds of `.base` files, bare numbers. Counting
//! those as rot inflates the number and, worse, makes it unexplainable — the
//! figure moves and nobody can say whether the vault got better. So the report
//! carries both: every unresolved target, and the subset that actually looks
//! like a note. A migration is judged on the second and audited on the first.
//!
//! ## Why a target is also read relative to the note that carries it
//!
//! Obsidian resolves `[[x]]` against three addresses, not one: the path as
//! written from the vault root, the same path read from the linking note's own
//! folder, and finally the name alone. This resolver knew the first and the
//! third, which is why `_attachments/E-Autos-/Image 3.jpg` — written in a note
//! that has an `_attachments/` folder sitting beside it — read as dead. There is
//! no `_attachments/` at the vault root, and 35 files in this vault are called
//! `Image 3.jpg`, so rung one missed and rung three refused to guess. The rung
//! that would have answered was not there.
//!
//! Measured on the operator's vault 2026-09-08: **8,034 dead links before,
//! 5,211 after, 2,823 of them recovered by this rung alone** — 2,763 attachments
//! and 60 notes. No file moved. PRD D4 had attributed 2,739 of those to "image
//! links whose files are not in the vault"; the files are in the vault, one
//! folder below the note that names them. (5,184 once the bracket rule in
//! `targets_in` stopped counting Mermaid nodes and NumPy literals as links.)
//!
//! This is not the same act as guessing at an ambiguous basename, and the
//! difference is why it belongs here while that still does not: a relative path
//! names exactly one file, so the resolver either finds that file or does not.
//! Nothing is picked.
