//! One train's actual stops on one day, from the same published files the
//! aggregate is built from.
//!
//! `ingest` projects six of the sixteen columns in each monthly parquet and
//! folds the rest away into per-cell histograms. That is the right shape for
//! "how late is an ICE at this station at this hour", and it cannot answer "how
//! late was ICE 611 at Bonn Hbf on the 14th" at all, because the ride is gone by
//! the time the histogram exists.
//!
//! The columns to answer it are already on disk: `train_number`,
//! `train_line_ride_id`, `train_line_station_num`, and the planned/actual
//! arrival and departure times are decompressed on every ingest and discarded.
//! This reads them instead.
//!
//! Three honesty constraints come with the dataset and are part of the answer:
//!
//! - Publication lags a journey by up to five weeks, so a recent trip is simply
//!   not here yet. That is different from a train that did not run.
//! - Collection is 98.92% complete with named missing hours, so an absent row
//!   never means "did not run" either.
//! - The raw directory is a prunable cache. A month that was pruned reads as
//!   unavailable, and this says so rather than returning nothing.
//!
//! All three collapse into the same rule: an absent row is reported as absent,
//! with the reason, and never as an empty result that looks like a measurement.
