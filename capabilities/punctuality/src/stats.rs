//! The aggregate itself: one histogram per cell, exact quantiles, bounded memory.
//!
//! A cell is a (station, train type, hour of day, weekend) bucket, and what it holds
//! is a count per delay minute rather than the delay values themselves. That choice is
//! what makes a single pass over ~120M stop records fit in memory: delays are small
//! integers, so a fixed array of counters is a complete description of the
//! distribution, and quantiles read straight off the cumulative counts instead of
//! needing the samples kept around and sorted.
//!
//! Measured against the real data (2026-06, 14.75M rows) before the window was chosen:
//! delays span -120..1421 minutes, but 99.906% of them land in [-5, 120]. So the two
//! open-ended edge buckets absorb roughly one row in a thousand, and every quantile
//! anyone asks for in practice (p50, p90) sits far inside the closed range. The mean is
//! kept as a running sum and is exact regardless of bucketing.
