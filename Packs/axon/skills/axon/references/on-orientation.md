# Orient to repository work

Run this sequence before planning, reviewing, or editing:

1. Run `git status --short --branch`. Preserve unrelated changes and identify the active branch.
2. Run `tools/doctor`. Treat its findings independently and keep unrelated failures outside the
   change scope.
3. Run `scripts/axon-context on [unit-or-path]`.
4. Read only the paths it returns plus the reference selected in `SKILL.md`.

Use `tools/self explain <unit>` for ownership and local coupling, and `tools/self coupling` for a
relationship question. Use `rg` and tracked source for exact implementation evidence. Use
Graphify only for symbol-level traversal when a current graph is available.

State the intended file and change scope before editing. Do not absorb nearby cleanup merely
because doctor, status, or a search exposed it.
