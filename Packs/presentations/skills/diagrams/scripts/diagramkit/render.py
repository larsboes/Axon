"""Render .mmd sources with mermaid-cli, and report the aspect each one landed at.

Two things here are deliberate.

**The renderer is pinned.** Axon's dependency doctrine is a pinned version, never
a floating release; `DIAGRAMS_MERMAID_CLI` exists so a bump is a decision someone
made rather than a side effect of a render. mermaid-cli downloads a Chromium on
first use — see `diagrams doctor`.

**The size is reported.** A figure's aspect ratio is the number that decides
where it can sit on a slide, and it is a property of the node text, not something
anyone predicts. `layout.picture()` fits a box, so knowing the aspect before the
first build saves a render-look-adjust cycle.
